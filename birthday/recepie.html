      <h3>How to make a dough:</h3>
      <ol>
        <li>
             Mound the flour onto a clean work surface.
             Use the back of your hand or the bottom of a bowl to create a wide, shallow well in the mound. 
             The “walls” of the mound should be just high enough to keep the eggs in the well.
        </li>
        <p></p>
        <li>
             Crack eggs into the well and use a fork to beat them lightly but thoroughly with a fork.
             Whisk in 1 tablespoon of extra virgin olive oil.
        </li>
        <p></p>
        <li>
             Begin adding flour into the eggs by pulling it, little by little, from the inside walls of the mound.
        </li>
        <p></p>
        <li>
             Continue to incorporate until the mixture is like a thick batter, then a rough, sticky dough.
             Use a dough scraper to help scrape up any shaggy bits from the work surface and to incorporate the flour into the eggs.
             Switch to your hands and begin kneading the dough together. 
        </li>
        <p></p>
        <li>
             Continue to knead for 5 to 10 minutes, until the dough is smooth, firm, and supple.
             If you press your finger into the dough, it should spring back, though you should still see an imprint.
             Cover the dough with plastic wrap or a bowl and let it rest for 1 hour.
        </li>
      </ol>

    <h3>Thats where you'll need the pasta maker!</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Prepare your machine by setting up the preferred thikness and sprinkle the surface with flour.</li>
        <p></p>
        <li>Devide the dough in 4 parts. Wrap 3 of them, and begin working with the first one, you need to make a chunky piece - flat!</li>
        <p></p>
        <li>Then roll the dough through the machine, cut, freeze or cook!</li>
